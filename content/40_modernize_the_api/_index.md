# Modernize the Catalog API
Now that we have an instance of our existing Catalog API running in our AWS account linked to our Stackery account and we've installed the .NET Core SDK it's time to dig in.

We're going to start by [creating a new Stackery Stack](./40_modernize_the_api/10_create_stack.html) with all the AWS infrastructure necessary to modernize the Books controller of the API.
