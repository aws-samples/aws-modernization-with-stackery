# Getting Started

If you are at an AWS event where Event Engine is being used and you want to use a free, temporary AWS account, continue onto [Logging into AWS Event Engine](./20_getting_started/10_event_engine.html).

Otherwise, continue onto [Creating or Using an Existing Account](./20_getting_started/20_existing_account.html) to setup the workshop in a new or existing AWS account.
